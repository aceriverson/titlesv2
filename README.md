## Automatically title your runs

Using the Web UI, create and name boundaries on the map. When a Strava activity passes through the boundary, it will rename the activity.

(For specificity, if more than one boundary is crossed, the boundary whose centerpoint is furthest from the start of the activity will be selected for naming.)
